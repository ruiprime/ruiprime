Hello! I'm Ricky Wang. Thank you for stopping by my site.

My research interests are bioinformatics.I'm also interested in more applied problems with nice theoretical components.I'm a serial side project maker. In the last 3 years, I've started 13 side projects in many different areas. Few are wildly popular. Many are dead. Several of them are still hanging around today.

Thank you for stopping by! I would love to learn what brought you here. I want to hear your stories, your interests, and your questions.You can contact me through email wx#ruiprime.cn.
